What I Did
Today, I uploaded the first version of my project to GitHub. This marks the beginning of version control for the work I’m doing. I wanted to make sure all my files were backed up, organized, and available in one place online, where I could also track my progress and return to older versions if needed.
I created a new repository on GitHub and used the "Upload files" option directly on the website. I selected all the files from my local project folder and dragged them into the upload area. This included HTML, CSS, JavaScript files (if any), as well as any assets like images or icons, and maybe a README if I had already written one.
Once the files were uploaded, GitHub asked me to "commit" the changes. It gave me a default message that said "Add files via GitHub," which is fine, but I wrote my own short message to be more specific about what was included in this upload. Then I clicked "Commit changes" to finalize the upload.

Why I Did It
The reason I uploaded the project to GitHub is simple: I want to keep track of every change I make as I build this thing. Whether I’m working alone or plan to work with others later, using version control is a smart move. It gives me a clean history of what I did, when I did it, and why.
I also want to make my project easier to share with others. If someone asks me what I’m working on, I can just send them the GitHub link. If I mess something up in my code later, I can roll back to a version that worked. Plus, it just feels good to see progress in a visible way.

What Files I Uploaded
Here’s a quick breakdown of what I included in this first upload:
My main HTML file (usually index.html)
CSS files for styling the site
JavaScript files for interactive functionality (if needed)
Images, logos, icons (in an /assets or /images folder)
A README file (or I’ll add one later).
gitignore (if there are any files I want Git to ignore)
I kept things organized in folders so it’s easier to find stuff later. Clean structure now = less stress later.

Next Steps
Now that my project is on GitHub, I’ll be:
Making regular commits every time I finish a new feature or fix something
Possibly creating branches if I want to test a feature without breaking the main version
Updating the README file so it clearly explains what the project is, how to use it, and how to contribute (if it’s public)
Continuing development locally and pushing my updates to GitHub regularly

Final Thoughts
Uploading to GitHub was a small step, but an important one. It officially kicks off the version-controlled life of my project. I’m excited to keep building, track my work, and maybe even share this with others once it’s more complete.
If I hit any major roadblocks or make cool breakthroughs, I’ll document those too. For now, I’m just glad everything is saved and I have a solid foundation to work from.
